  paragraph1: I remember our first magic carpet ride. We were flying into the sunrise
    when you kissed me. You still tasted like cherry cordial. You were so deliciously
    shy.
  paragraph2: "Now, I know better, and I can laugh at how gullible I was. When I
    finish telling everyone what I went through, it\u2019s like you\u2019ve lost
    your hold on my past. My memories are my own again."
  paragraph3: "I can\u2019t do this anymore. I\u2019m suffering because of how much
    you mean to me. Heartache eats away at my memories of your head on my chest."
  paragraph4: "Let\u2019s cherish this for what it was. I wish we could have saved
    each other from the anguish of the last few weeks. We made our choices. Maybe
    this is just how this story had to end."
